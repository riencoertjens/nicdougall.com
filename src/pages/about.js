            <i>Early Years</i> - U19 Sprint Distance World Champion 2009
          </strong>
          <br />
          I've always had a passion for sport and as a kid I played almost
          everything from Waterpolo to Aussie Rules football, but endurance
          sport was where I started to focus my attention as a teenager. After
          swimming and running competitively for a few years my attention was
          captured by Triathlon in high school. During that time I made 3 state
          teams and won the 16-19 Age Group Sprint Distance World Championships
          in 2009.

            2016
          </strong>
          <br />
          After 2009 I made the decision to focus on cycling with the goal of
          making it to the highest level of the sport. In 2014 I turned
          professional with MTN Qhubeka, which later became Team Dimension Data
          after it was granted World Tour status in 2016. I was fortunate enough
          to ride some of the biggest races in the world with this team
          including 2 Vuelta Espanas and the big Spring Classics like De Ronde
          van Vlaanderen. I also placed Top 20 at Road Worlds in 2016.

            <i>The Return to the roots</i>
          </strong>
          <br />
          In 2019 I'm excited to be returning to my passion for Triathlon. I've
          missed the variety and the challenge that only the combination of
          three sports can provide. I'll always be thankful for my time in the
          peloton but at the same time I'm extremely excited to be chasing my
          own personal success as a triathlete.

            <i>Family</i>
          </strong>
          <br />I met my amazing wife Brooke in Brisbane, Australia when I was
          19 years old and since then we’ve traveled the world together. She is
          the most thoughtful and caring person I have ever met. Professional
          sport involves huge sacrifices and I certainly wouldn’t have been able
          to spend the last 7 years chasing my dreams if it wasn’t for her. We
          also have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Dora who loves to lick
          all the salt off my legs when I come home from a ride or run and
          cuddle on the couch with us when its raining.
